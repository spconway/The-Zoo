# The-Zoo

##Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The Zoo is a multi-class C++ interfacing prototype system for the Wildlife Zoo that incorporates Java
for certain functionalities.

The program will display a menu for which the user has the following options:

• Load Animal Data

• Generate Data

• Display Animal Data

• Add Record

• Delete Record

• Save Animal Data

##What did you do particularly well?

I would like to think I implemented memory management well and also designed the program to appropriately use pointers.

##Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think designing base classes and derived class could be improved upon greatly. Also I should address virtual methods of the base/derived classes.

Another area for improvement would be file writing. Currently it does not appear to have any set formatting when writing as writing to a file happens two different ways currently.

##Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

Dealing with pointers was pretty challenging but I created a "resolver" class which will handle creating new derived classes and assigning them to a vector for memory storage.

##What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Creating base/derived classes is a good skill to get used to calling upon, if my next project involves java that would obviously change slightly with the inclusion of interfaces. Correctly handling memory management and pointers is always a good skill to transfer to other projects (only as needed though).

##How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Comments and descriptive naming!
